# CLAUDE.md — ChainLex

## Overview

ChainLex is a legal reasoning framework implementing a multi-level inference system for South African law. It provides hierarchical knowledge representation of legal principles and rules across 8 major legal branches using Scheme-based definitions, hypergraph structures, and a Python API.

## Languages

- **Python 3.6+** — Primary implementation (~2,700 LOC)
- **Scheme** — Legal knowledge representation (22 `.scm` files)

## Key Commands

```bash
# Run tests
python3 test_suite.py

# Run demo
python3 demo.py

# Rebuild framework index
python3 framework_index.py

# Validate framework consistency
python3 framework_validator.py

# Use the API
python3 chainlex_api.py
```

## Dependencies

Core library uses Python standard library only (`json`, `pathlib`, `typing`, `re`, `pickle`, `unittest`).

Optional dependencies for advanced features:
- `networkx` — hypergraph building/queries
- `torch` — GNN models
- `sqlalchemy` / `psycopg2` — PostgreSQL integration

## Architecture

### Multi-Level Inference
- **Level 1**: First-order legal principles (60+ maxims in `lv1/known_laws.scm`)
- **Level 2+**: Derived rules across 8 jurisdictional domains
- Rules chain from principles through confidence-based inference

### Legal Domains
8 branches of South African law, each in its own directory with Scheme definitions:
`civ`, `cri`, `con`, `lab`, `env`, `adm`, `cst`, `int`

### Hypergraph System
Graph-based representation of legal knowledge with 2,300+ nodes, supporting NetworkX traversal, Neo4j export, and GNN-based reasoning.

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Legal Nodes | 2,306 |
| Level 1 Principles | 63 |
| Level 2+ Rules | 2,215+ |
| Legal Domains | 28+ |
| Scheme Files | 22 |

## Conventions

- Legal rules are defined as Scheme S-expressions with structured headers
- Each framework file includes metadata: domain, level, confidence scores
- The `framework_index.json` maps all rules for fast lookup
- Python API follows a layered pattern: `ChainLex` → `PrinciplesAPI` / `RulesAPI` / `InferenceAPI`

## ⛔ Withdrawn claims — check before reusing any case finding (2026-10-10)

Case claims withdrawn or corrected in cogpy/ad-res-j7 are mirrored in `docs/strategic/WITHDRAWN_CLAIMS_REGISTER.json` (ad-res-j7 is canonical). `.github/workflows/withdrawn-claims-guard.yml` fails a PR that adds a line repeating one; `python3 scripts/check_withdrawn_claims.py --report` lists remaining copies, and `scripts/add_withdrawn_banners.py --apply` banners files that carry them. Headline corrections: the SLG R5,241,372.98 write-off is an accounting residue, not stolen stock; Ketoni R18,685,000 is a contingent call-option price, not a debt or payout; the 18 Feb 2024 R246,372,003.80 trial balance is the live books carrying mis-scaled journal 789, reversed at year end; Bantjies did not commission his own affidavit; Shopify orders were rerouted, not audit trails deleted. Detail: ad-res-j7 `docs/strategic/CONSOLIDATED_INVESTIGATION_REPORT_2026_10_05.md` and `docs/strategic/OLX_COMPLETE_SYNC_2026_10_10.md`.
